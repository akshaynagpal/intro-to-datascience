    "While some computers come with Python already installed, such as those running macOS, we will need a number of other Python tools (packages) in order to effectively manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. This guide will walk you through the easiest ways to set up your own data science environment, from installing python to running your first Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0a. Using Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend that you download and use\n",
    "[Conda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), an open-source package\n",
    "manager for scientific computing. Why? Well, scientific computing\n",
    "packages typically link to some heavy-duty C and Fortran libraries.\n",
    "Conda makes it extremely easy to install these cross-language\n",
    "dependencies easily on all major platforms. If you don't use Conda,\n",
    "you might have to spend time messing around with installing an entire\n",
    "Fortran toolchain, which is definitely not fun (especially on Windows). This might take a long time to download so make sure you have a strong wifi signal!\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install Conda is with Anaconda (you should pick python 2), which is essentially Conda bundled with two dozen commonly\n",
    "installed dependencies. Anaconda comes with\n",
    "[Spyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyder_%28software%29) a nice IDE\n",
    "for Python data science.  We will also use [Jupyter\n",
    "notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), which let you code in the browser (this\n",
    "curriculum was originally developed on a Jupyter notebook, and we do\n",
    "make use of a couple Jupyter-specific commands).\n",
    "\n",
    "Be warned, though: Anaconda installs a _lot_ of packages.  If you're\n",
    "strapped for hard drive space, consider installing\n",
    "[Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), the minimal\n",
    "distribution with Conda.\n",
    "After installing Conda, open up a command prompt (`cmd.exe` for Windows\n",

    "\n",
    "We highly suggest using conda for easy package management. You should only be using python without conda if you do not have root access to your machine.\n",

    "If you're not using Conda, then we recommend you install Python 2.7 from\n",
